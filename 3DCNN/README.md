## 3D CNN
### Downloading the Data
Meshes & Labels: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ny_H5a0CobkbChiAQMkfG6TdyDIMtKsd/view?usp=sharing

### Running the Network
1. Upload the 3D CNN notebook files (one_model_regression_once_data_loaded.ipynb, one_model_classification_once_data_loaded.ipynb, and one_model_classification_once_data_loaded_scale.ipynb) to the Google Drive repository you intend to use.
2. Download the meshes & labels file (link above) and move it to the Google Drive repository you intend to use. Change file path in "Load numpy array" block of code to match where you put the meshes & labels files.
3. Run any of the 3D CNN notebooks!
4. Note: you will need a wandB account for the wandB blocks of code to run. If you don't have a wandB account remove these sections of code (Wandb Install, Wandb Imports, Wandb Ininitialization, Finish WandB, and the callbacks in Training Model and Evaluate Model) and the code should still run.
